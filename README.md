# System requirments
TeraWarp works on desktop computers, for terabyte-scale data, our recommended computer configurations for efficiency gains are as follows:

## - Required device
RAM: 64GB or larger

CPU: 2.3GHz Intel Xeon Gold or better

Hard disk: Three times the size of the original image or larger

## - Optional device
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU or better

(Note: The time required for image warping is closely related to GPU, and we recommend using GPU to process the image.)

# Installation
TeraWarp is accessible as an open-source plugin for the Vaa3D platform. The tool supports Windows 64-bit systems and popular Linux distributions. The basis for successfully compiling TeraWarp is that you have installed Vaa3D.


## - Windows
